# ⏰ InTime - Make Your Todos  

InTime is a **simple todo-list website** made to help you **track and manage your tasks**.  
No internet 🌐, no login 🔑 — everything is stored **right on your computer** 💻.

## 💡 Inspiration
We used to write our daily schedules on paper 📝.  
But it was time-consuming ⌛ and wasted a lot of paper 🌳.  

So, we decided to turn our programming skills 💻 into a solution:  
👉 a website that replaces manual lists with a digital one.
